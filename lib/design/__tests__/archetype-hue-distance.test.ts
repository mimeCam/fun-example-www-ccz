/**
 * archetype-hue-distance — per-surface Δh floor audit for archetype voices.
 *
 * The five archetype families (`cyan`, `accent`, `secondary`, `rose`,
 * `amber`) speak through one surface today: the NextRead farewell chip
 * (`components/reading/NextRead.tsx`, via `lib/design/archetype-accents.
 * ts`). They do not speak as one register — each archetype is a *voice*,
 * and two voices that paint the same surface must be telling apart on the
 * wheel: a sighted reader who sees a cyan chip yesterday and a secondary
 * chip today should feel "different person," not "different mood of the
 * same person."
 *
 * The fence: on each surface that paints ≥ 2 archetype families, the
 * minimum circular hue distance between any two of those families must
 * clear `HUE_FLOOR_DEG` (4°). The floor is empirical — today's tightest
 * pair sits at ~5.35° (`accent` = `#c77dff` ↔ `secondary` = `#bc8cf0`,
 * both in the violet hue family by intent) — so 4° is "today's reality
 * minus ~1.35° margin," not eyeballed (Mike #78 §6 #6: floors are
 * calibrated, not vibe-checked).
 *
 * **Receipt of the discovery (Sid 2026-04-26).** Mike's napkin sketched
 * a 15° floor; the empirical reality is ~5.35°. The two violet siblings
 * — Tailwind's `accent` (Explorer voice) and `secondary` (Faithful
 * Reader voice) — sit closer on the wheel than the napkin assumed. The
 * audit pins today's spread at 4° and surfaces the discovery as a number
 * (snapshot §4) rather than going red on commit zero (Mike's "an
 * assertion that goes red on commit zero is a sentence pretending to be
 * code"). A future palette nudge that wants the napkin's 15° target
 * lands as a deliberate brand change in `lib/design/color-constants.ts`
 * (`BRAND.accentViolet` or `BRAND.secondary`) — out of scope this sprint
 * per Krystle / Mike POI #3.
 *
 * **Per-surface, not global.** Elon §4 (via Mike napkin) — Jason's
 * "every voice on the wheel is safely far from every other voice"
 * invariant is structurally false (`accent` and `secondary` are by
 * design siblings in the same violet family). The honest question is
 * the per-surface one: *on the surfaces that paint these families
 * together, do the families distinguish?* Yes. Receipt below.
 *
 * **Receipt as snapshot.** The full Δh pair table is snapshotted to
 * `__snapshots__/archetype-hue-distance.test.ts.snap` so a hue change
 * to any archetype family shows up in PR review as a number, not as a
 * vibe (Tanya UX #60 §3 / UX #67 §3: numbers, not adjectives).
 *
 * **No new constants, no palette nudge.** Families are read from
 * `lib/design/archetype-accents.ts`; painted hexes resolve through the
 * canvas-safe `BRAND` map in `lib/design/color-constants.ts`. No new
 * ledger, no new Voice atom, no new alpha rung. (Mike napkin #54 / #70
 * §A: no ninth ledger.)
 *
 * **Rule-of-three, scoped to surfaces.** Today exactly ONE surface
 * paints all five archetype families (the NextRead chip). A *second*
 * surface that paints two-or-more archetype families graduates the
 * `ARCHETYPE_SURFACES` table; a *third* graduates the table into a
 * `Surface` row on `lib/design/voice-ledger.ts`. Until then, the local
 * data + audit is the right level of fence (Krystle deferral; Mike
 * napkin POI #7).
 *
 * Pure Jest. No DOM, no Canvas, no thermal lerp. Reuses
 * `lib/design/hue.ts` so the math kernel is one place — drift = red.
 *
 * Credits: Krystle Clear (the engineering pick — per-surface audit at
 * a defensible floor); Elon M. (#54 / §4 — the per-surface vs global
 * teardown that killed the headline invariant before commit zero); Jason
 * F. (the "same wheel" framing — one docblock sentence in `hue.ts` is his
 * salvageable kernel); Mike K. (napkin — rule-of-three on surfaces, the
 * 15° floor as today-minus-margin); Tanya D. (UX #60 §3, UX #67 §3 —
 * "numbers, not adjectives"; the receipt snapshot is the trust signal);
 * Paul K. (the business-side outcome — "two readers, one URL, no voice
 * collision" — the audit makes mechanical).
